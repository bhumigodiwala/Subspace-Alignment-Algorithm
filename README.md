# Subspace Alignment Algorithm for Domain Adaptation

Subspace Alignment Algorithm is a Domain Adaptation algorithm that uses domain invariant feature space. In this algorithm, the source and the target domains are represented using Eigenvectors. It generates a feature space that allows mapping of the source dataset to the target dataset so that the source data closely aligns with the target data for classification thereby improving the accuracy and performance of the algorithm.

The aim of this Analysis is to verify the efficiency of the Subspace Alignment Algorithm. We are considering the case of Supervised Learning to explore the impacts of applying Subspace Alignment Algorithm. The perfomance metrics considered for comparison with a supervised learning classifier is Accuracy and KL Divergence. The algorithm compares the results on applying k-Nearest Neighbours Classification on the datasets. 

The model is trained on randomly sampled data from the source dataset and tested on the target dataset. Both these source and target datastes comrpises of data collected from different sources like webcam, dslr and amazon. The algorithm is implemented for a 10 class classification problem.

The key observations suggest:
1. The datasets need to be quite large and consist of number of features
2. The Accuracy varies when we randomly sample fractions of source data for different random seed values. However, the accuracy converges once we randomly sample approximately 75-80% of the source data
3. Applying Subspace Alignment and PCA drastically reduces the KL divergence values between the source and the target datasets.
4. There is reduction in KL divergence for data specific to every class

Requirements to run the file:
The virtual env is stored in venv.yml file. To save the conda virtual environment to yml file use the following command

```
conda activate {$ myenv}
conda env export > {$ environment}.yml
```

To run and observe the results:

```
python3 evaluation.py
```
