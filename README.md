# Subspace Alignment Algorithm for Domain Adaptation

Subspace Alignment Algorithm is a new Domain Adaptation algorithm that uses a domain invariant feature space. In this algorithm, the source and the target domains are represented using Eigenvectors. It generates a feature space that allows mapping of the source dataset to the target dataset so that the source data closely aligns with the target data.
