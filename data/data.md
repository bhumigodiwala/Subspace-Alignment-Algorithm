1. The Subspace Alignment Algorithm has benn tested on a variety of datasets like CaffeNet 4096, GoogleNet 1024 and the Surf dataset.
2. Each dataset comprises of data collected from different sources like webcam, dslr, amazon
3. The algorithm is tested by considering one of these data sources as source data and target data respectively.

The DIrectory Structure for Data is as below:
